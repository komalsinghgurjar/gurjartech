    <h1>Privacy Policy for Floating Timer App</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: May 9, 2024</p>
    <p>Thank you for using Floating Timer (the "App"). This Privacy Policy outlines the information practices associated with your use of the App. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information while providing you with a seamless user experience. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we collect, use, and disclose your information.</p>
    <h2>Information Collection and Use:</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Data Collection:</strong> The App does not collect any personally identifiable information from its users. We do not require you to provide any personal information to use the App.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Analytics:</strong> We utilize Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics services provided by Google to collect anonymous usage data and error reports to improve the performance and user experience of the App. This data may include information such as device model, operating system version, and usage patterns, but it does not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p>3. <strong>Remote Config:</strong> The App may use Firebase Remote Config to dynamically adjust app settings and features based on aggregated user data. This data is used solely to enhance the functionality and performance of the App and does not include any personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h2>Advertising:</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>AdMob:</strong> The App displays personalized ads provided by AdMob, a mobile advertising platform operated by Google. AdMob may collect and use information about your device and online activity to serve personalized ads based on your interests. AdMob may also use unique identifiers, such as Advertising IDs, to track and personalize ads.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings or by visiting Google's Ad Settings (<a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a>). Please note that opting out of personalized advertising does not mean you will no longer see ads; it simply means that the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>
    <h2>Data Sharing:</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We may share anonymous usage data and analytics with third-party service providers, such as Firebase and AdMob, for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. These service providers are contractually obligated to use the data only for the purposes specified by us and to protect the confidentiality and security of the data.</p>
    <p>2. <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We may disclose information about you if required to do so by law or in response to a valid legal request, such as a court order or subpoena.</p>
    <h2>Data Security:</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Security Measures:</strong> We take reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    <h2>Children's Privacy:</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Age Requirement:</strong> The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately so that we can take appropriate action.</p>
